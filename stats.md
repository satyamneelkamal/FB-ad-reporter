### Regional Performance Insights

#### üèÜ Top Performing Regions

- **Uttar Pradesh & Odisha** lead in spend (‚Çπ9,279 & ‚Çπ9,137) but show vastly different CTRs (0.38% vs 2.39%)
- **Delhi** has exceptional reach (2M+) with ultra-low CPM (‚Çπ1.63) but poor CTR (0.04%)
- **Chhattisgarh** shows the best CPC efficiency at ‚Çπ2.28 per click

#### ‚ö†Ô∏è Areas of Concern

- **Delhi's Low CTR:** Despite massive reach, Delhi shows only 0.04% CTR - suggests poor targeting or creative relevance
- **High CPC Variance:** CPC ranges from ‚Çπ2.28 to ‚Çπ4.31, indicating inconsistent performance
- **UP's Low CTR:** Highest spending region has one of the lowest CTRs (0.38%)

#### üéØ Regional Optimization Strategy

1. **Reduce Delhi budget** \- Poor CTR despite low CPM suggests wrong audience
2. **Increase investment in Odisha, West Bengal, Tamil Nadu** \- Better CTR (2.3-2.7%)
3. **Test regional creative** \- Adapt messaging for local languages and preferences
4. **Implement geo-bid adjustments** \- Lower bids in Delhi, higher in high-CTR regions
5. **Consider logistics costs** \- Factor shipping costs to distant regions in ROAS calculations

### Campaign Performance Comparison

### Campaign Type Insights

#### üí° Performance Analysis by Campaign Type

- **Sales Campaigns:** Main revenue drivers but operating at a loss (ROAS < 1.0)
- **Retargeting:** Significantly underperforming with only 0.62 ROAS - needs immediate attention
- **Awareness Campaign:** Excellent reach efficiency at ‚Çπ1.64 CPM but currently paused
- **Budget Allocation:** 100% of active budget on purchase-focused campaigns, missing top-funnel opportunities

#### üéØ Recommended Campaign Mix

Based on current performance, consider this optimized campaign structure:

- **40% - Awareness/Consideration:** Reactivate with improved targeting
- **40% - Direct Sales:** Focus on high-performing audiences (25-44 age group)
- **20% - Retargeting:** Rebuild with dynamic product ads and better segmentation

## Key Insights & Strategic Recommendations

- ‚ö†Ô∏è

**Critical: ROAS Below Breakeven**

Both active campaigns are generating ROAS below 1.0 (0.93 and 0.62), meaning you're losing money on every sale. The retargeting campaign is performing particularly poorly with only 0.62 ROAS.

- üë•

**Age Demographics Concentration**

The 25-34 and 35-44 age groups account for 73% of total ad spend (‚Çπ31,258). These are your primary audiences and should be the focus of optimization efforts. Consider creating age-specific creative and messaging.

- üí∞

**High Customer Acquisition Cost**

At ‚Çπ232.78 per purchase, your acquisition costs may be unsustainable. This suggests either your average order value is too low, or conversion optimization is needed.

- üéØ

**Gender Targeting Imbalance**

Males account for 75% of ad spend (‚Çπ35,948) vs females at 25% (‚Çπ11,969). Analyze if this matches your actual customer base and product appeal.

- üìä

**CPM Efficiency Variance**

The main campaign has better CPM (‚Çπ60.02) compared to retargeting (‚Çπ76.37), suggesting broader targeting is more cost-effective for reach. The awareness campaign had exceptional CPM at ‚Çπ1.64.

- üîÑ

**Retargeting Underperformance**

Your retargeting campaign is 33% less effective than your cold traffic campaign. This is unusual and suggests issues with audience quality, creative relevance, or offer appeal.


#### üöÄ Immediate Action Items (Next 7 Days)

1. **Pause the retargeting campaign immediately** \- It's hemorrhaging money at 0.62 ROAS
2. **Conduct creative testing** \- Low ROAS often indicates creative fatigue or poor message-market fit
3. **Implement conversion rate optimization** on landing pages to improve purchase rates
4. **Audit your pricing strategy** \- Ensure margins can support ‚Çπ233 customer acquisition cost
5. **Set up proper attribution tracking** to capture full customer journey and delayed conversions

#### üìà 30-Day Strategic Plan

- **Rebuild Retargeting Strategy:**
  - Segment audiences by engagement level (cart abandoners, product viewers, past purchasers)
  - Implement dynamic product ads showing exact products viewed
  - Test different time windows (1-day, 7-day, 30-day)
- **Optimize Age & Gender Targeting:**
  - Create separate ad sets for 25-34 and 35-44 age groups
  - Test female-focused creative to improve gender balance
  - Exclude underperforming age groups (65+)
- **Diversify Campaign Types:**
  - Reactivate awareness campaigns for top-funnel growth
  - Test video content for better engagement
  - Implement lead generation campaigns for email list building

#### üí° Long-term Growth Strategy

To achieve sustainable profitability, focus on these strategic initiatives:

- **Lifetime Value Optimization:** Implement email marketing and loyalty programs to increase repeat purchases
- **Product-Market Fit:** Survey customers to understand why ROAS is low and adjust product offerings
- **Creative Excellence:** Invest in high-quality video content and user-generated content campaigns
- **Multi-Channel Approach:** Diversify beyond Facebook to Google Ads, influencer marketing, and organic social
- **Data Infrastructure:** Implement proper tracking, analytics, and attribution modeling
